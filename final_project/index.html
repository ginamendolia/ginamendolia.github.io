						<div id="about_main"
							<p><strong><a href="www.openbiome.org">Poop scientist</a> by trade; engineer by design.</strong> I'm driven by unmet public health need, inspired by mindfulness, and attracted to simplicity.</p>
							<p>I tell product stories by researching what people need, brainstorming ideas, prototyping, and iterating based on user feedback. My process is flexible so that my design account for the ecosystem while addressing distinct needs.</p>
							<p>When I am not reimagining systems, you can generally find me doodling, touting the superiority of homemade tomato sauce over Ragu, or somewhere on a mountain--skiing, biking, running, or climbing.</p>
							<p><strong>As a graduate student</strong> at Stanford University, I am interested in how harnessing individual decision making to increase the overall health and sustainability of communities.</p>

								<h4>Challenge</h4>
								<p>Fecal matter is not the easiest thing to encapsulate. It’s 70 percent water; when you put it into a gelatin capsule, a traditional shell for drugs, the capsule melts from the inside out.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="CaseStudySummary-group">
								<h4>Impact</h4>
								<p>Over 250k pills have been made using my method. To date, the pill I designed has treated over 2,000 patients with C. diff and has been used to study the effects of FMT in 25+ clinical trials including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), immuno-oncology (I/O), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).</p>
							</div>

							<div class="CaseStudySummary-group">
								<h4>Lessons</h4>
								<p>Be prepared to change your approach for different parts of the process. Development, scaling, and operations rely on different skills. Pausing to acknowledge that you’re shifting your “skill gears” is worth-while. </p>

								<h4>Background</h4>
								<p>One of the most common hospital infections, <span class="sci_words">Clostridium difficile</span>, also known as “C. diff,” inflicts debilitating symptoms, affects over 500,000 Americans each year, and kills almost 30,000 of them.  When antibiotics don’t work, a Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) can be used to send an army of good bacteria into your gut to crowd out the infection. Patients feel better within hours 90 percent of the time! FMT works in just the opposite way antibiotics do. Where antibiotics wipe out infection, FMT overflows the area, leaving the infectious bacteria with nowhere to hide. Until 2015, doctors would administer an FMT via a colonoscopy or endoscopy tube, an invasive but effective medical procedure. </p>
								<p>My solution was to create small “fences” around bubbles of poop by mixing a hydrophobic (water-hating) liquid with the hydrophilic (water-loving) active ingredient (the poop).  In real life that means, I created a poop pill: shelf-stable, orally available dosage form of FMT delivered by Microbial Emulsion Matrix Technology (MEM Tech).</p>

								<h4>Timeline</h4>
								<p>September 2014 - May 2015</p>
								<h4>Team</h4>
								<p>To transform trash into treasure, I researched, designed, and executed all experiments. I worked with two microbiology PhDs for scientific support, a physician for clinical oversight, and a manufacturing team to bring the product to life at scale. </p>

								<h4>Process</h4>
								<p>Follow the photos below for descriptions of process, prototypes, and poop geysers. There were a few more ups and downs, many more protoypes, and infinitely more failures not recorded in the following diagrams.</p>
