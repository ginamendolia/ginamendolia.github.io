                <h3>Poop Pills</h3>
                <div>
                  <h4>Goal</h4>
                  <p>Develop a pill version of Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h4>Who</h4>
                  <p>OpenBiome</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>When</h4>
                  <p>September 2014 - May 2015</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  <p>One of the most common hospital infections, <span class="sci_words">Clostridium difficile</span>, also known as “C. diff,” inflicts debilitating symptoms, affects over 500,000 Americans each year, and kills almost 30,000 of them.  When antibiotics don’t work, a Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) can be used to send an army of good bacteria into your gut to crowd out the infection. Patients feel better within hours 90 percent of the time! FMT works in just the opposite way antibiotics do. Where antibiotics wipe out infection, FMT overflows the area, leaving the infectious bacteria with nowhere to hide. Until 2015, doctors would administer an FMT via a colonoscopy or endoscopy tube, an invasive but effective medical procedure. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Challenge</h4>
                  <p>Fecal matter is not the easiest thing to encapsulate. It’s 70 percent water; when you put it into a gelatin capsule, a traditional shell for drugs, the capsule melts from the inside out.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Team</h4>
                  <p>I researched, designed, and executed all experiments. I worked with two microbiology PhDs for scientific support, a physician for clinical oversight, and a manufacturing team to bring the product to life at scale. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>My solution was to create small “fences” around bubbles of poop by mixing a hydrophobic (water-hating) liquid with the hydrophilic (water-loving) active ingredient (the poop).  In real life that means, I created a poop pill: shelf-stable, orally available dosage form of FMT delivered by Microbial Emulsion Matrix Technology (MEM Tech).</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Impact</h4>
                  <p>Over 250k pills have been made using my method. To date, the pill I designed has treated over 2,000 patients with C. diff and has been used to study the effects of FMT in 25+ clinical trials including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), immuno-oncology (I/O), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).</p>

                  <h4>Process</h4>
                  <p>Follow the photos below for descriptions of process, prototypes, and poop geysers. There were a few more ups and downs, many more protoypes, and infinitely more failures not recorded in the following diagrams.</p>

                    <h5>Concept Doodling</h5>
                    <p>I started my assignment with a concept drawing.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                    <h5>First Idea Coating</h5>
                    <p>I knew that the water content of poop would melt the capsule from the inside out. So, I considered coating the outside of the capsule to keep the water in.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <img src="https://ginamendolia.github.io/unit_5/images/project_poop_pills/pegboard.JPG" alt="pegboard" Title="Pegboard prototype">

                    <h5>Hammering Out Prototypes</h5>
                    <p>While most coating processes are completed at a large scale, I started by making a small peg board to test different coatings.</p>
                    <p>Each capsule half rested on top of a nail while I poured the coatings over the top. This seemed promising until these capsules were stuck to the peg board causing the coating to flake off.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                    <h5>Outsourcing a Better Coat</h5>
                    <p>After a few hours, the professionally coated capsules started to pucker leading us to ponder what additional materials I could use to stablize the coating and capsule.</p>
                  </div>

                    <h5>Adding Stregnth</h5>
                    <p>I experimented with starches to fortify the coating. However, many of the added excipients did not react well to moisture or were too dry and increased flaking and cracking.</p>

                    <h5>Mixing up MEM Tech</h5>
                    <p>After many more failed prototypes and brainstorming sessions, Microbial Emulsion Matrix Technology was born!</p>
                    <p>Emulsions are mixtures of water and oil. I tested oils with varying melting and freezing points to find an oil combination that stayed solid at room temperature to immobilize the water droplets but liquid at body temperature to release the bubbles of microbiota after ingested by the patient.</p>

                    <h5>Stability Success</h5>
                    <p>After a poop-ton of failures and bad ideas, MEM Tech was a success. It proved to be stable at room temperature as well as resilent in frozen storage. And most importantly, the process seemed to be scalable. Shown is one of the first successful test batches.</p>

                    <h5>Scaling Improvements</h5>
                    <p>To ensure that the pills could be made at a reasonable scale, I tested the reproducibility of the recipe in larger and larger batches and worked with manufacturing technicians to smooth out handling and operating differences. </p>

                  <p>Be prepared to change your approach for different parts of the process. Development, scaling, and operations rely on different skills. Pausing to acknowledge that you’re shifting your “skill gears” is worth-while. </p>

                  <p>Digestive Disease Week (DDW) is one of the largest Gastrointestinal conferences in the world. DDW is academically focused but has a heavy industry presence. I created two infographic posters for display in OpenBiome’s booth. The posters keep with the organization’s inviting and patient-focused culture.</p>

                  <h4>Challenge</h4>
                  <p>These infographics had to appeal to a wide audience. In a traditional academic setting, the graphics had to balance dense content to provide important information with clean visuals to solidify a company brand.</p>

            <h3>Health Data Information System</h3>

              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>Centralized information system to manage donor health data</p>

              <h4>Who</h4>
              <p>Finch Therapeutics </p>

              <h4>When</h4>
              <p>January - October 2018</p>

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>The donor operations team at Finch Thereapeutics manages the health and activity of Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) donors. When the project started, information was entered, stored, and displayed across multiple platforms, such as RedCap, Excel, and paper logs.</p>

              <h4>Challenge</h4>
              <p>Clinical donor procedures were clear about documenting health data, but the requirements for supporting operations had to be discovered. It was not clear what data had to be recorded and when.</p>

              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>My role in this project was to provide oversight, facilitate resources, and cross-functional support, and most importantly act as the product owner. I was responsible for the technical design documentation as well as scoping, deciding priorities, and leading design brainstorms to determine the best configurations to meet the donor team’s needs. ​
              <br>My team spearheaded this project from requirements gathering and project management to development and design. My team consisted of a project manager, a business analyst, and a data analyst. We worked with the donor team as our “client.”</p>

              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>We started simple. We created a system that collects all the data in one place. We continue to leverage operating procedures. In future releases, the procedures will be upgraded to electronic workflows that lead the user through each step of data collection and reporting.</p>

              <h4>Impact</h4>
              <p>The donor operations team now has a unified electronic system that meets FDA clinical trial regulations and Good Documentation Practices (GDP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and HIPAA guidelines. This completes a vital step towards bringing more fecal microbiota drugs to market.</p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>My team and I focused stakeholder input on the “what,” not the “how” to better understand what activities the database system needed to support. We started this project by talking to the donor operations team about what features the system needed, what data the system should be able to collect, and in what ways they would reference the information.

              <br>After these initial sessions, we set up observation sessions to fill in the omitted or implied assumptions. We created process flow and UML-like diagrams to synthesize process information for our contracted development team.

              <br>Once configured, we worked with the quality team to validate the system to meet FDA  Phase I /II and GDP/GCP/ HIPAA compliance regulations. My team’s responsibilities extended to training sessions before and after the launch.</p>

              <h4>Lessons</h4>
              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Include the user from the beginning of the software development life cycle. It helps manage expectations if they understand why and how the process works.</li>

                  <li>Keep it simple and iterate. Be patient. I fell into the trap of designing process improvements in addition to the paper-to-computer transfer. Not recommended, unless otherwise outlined in your stakeholders’ requirements.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>We had to strike a delicate balance that managed the expectations of both leadership and the team at large. Leadership did not and could not promise anything before evaluating the suggestions, while the team wanted to see change happen quickly.</p>

              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>For this project, I partnered with Dan, a member of our sales team who had been at OpenBiome for almost as long as I had. We had different yet complementary skill sets, perspectives, and work functions.</p>

              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>We created a team engagement initiative comprised of a survey to solicit discussion topics, a workshop day focused on group problem solving, and task forces responsible for implementing changes. With multiple interations happening over time, we were able to signal a commitment to progress while remaining within leadership’s constraints.</p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>We designed a survey to find problems that the team wanted to talk about and then held a workshop to have cross-functional groups talk about those issues.Leading up to the workshop day, we coordinated the logistics for the day and created prompts, priming exercises, and worksheets for recording ideas about team communications, space, work-life balance. On the workshop day itself, Dan and I co-hosted the event and proctored discussions. We encouraged further conversation of the topics from the survey, and provided an executive summary to the leadership team that presented priorities, problems, and solutions thought through by the team.</p>

              <h4>Impact</h4>
              <p>The team was heard through multiple mediums and turned frustrations with growing pains into energy to improve processes and norms. </p>

              <h4>Lessons</h4>
              <p>Cross-functional problem solving depends on empathy and curiosity. The best problem solvers are the ones that find the problems in the first place.</p>
            <!--Project 5
            <h3>Cooking Work Book</h3>

              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>Eat affordable, nutritious, tasty, not boring lunch </p>

              <h4>Who</h4>
              <p>Me!</p>

              <h4>When</h4>
              <p>Summer & Fall 2018; on-going improvements</p>

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>I can survive most work days with a steady stream of coffee, but my effectiveness lags by the end of the day. This spring, hoping to increase my energy levels, I decided to take a few steps towards healthier eating. </p>

              <h4>Challenge</h4>
              <p>Fueling up just wasn’t my priority in a busy work day. Buying lunch every day is expensive. Meal prep seemed too monotonous. And I felt a lot of pressure to eat the “right” foods at every single meal.</p>

              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>I was both the project manager and user for this project and referred to a nutritionist as a subject matter expert for general diet guidelines. </p>

              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>A “Cooking Work Book” is a workbook that provides the structure for dietary habit change and the flexibility to integrate the habit into daily life. It can be used to introduce new foods into a diet or highlight food preferences and tendencies.</p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>My first step was listing all the food I like and realizing that much of it was considered to be “healthy.” I started off easy with frozen burritos and a simple grid. Week to week, I focused on adding a vegetable or side dish to expand the meal while taking notes about the foods that didn’t get eaten. It felt like I leveled-up in this game when I started to focus on bringing the right amounts of different ingredients so that I would have enough and not waste too much. Along the way I refined my note-taking structure to track info based on where I was on the J-curve of introducing a new habit, spice, or vegetable. </p>

              <h4>Impact</h4>
              <p>I’m not hangry at work anymore! And I have prototypes to create a responsive cooking work book.</p>

              <h4>Lessons</h4>
              <p>Habits are hard to break and make. It takes focus and effort; and so, any tool that keeps a goal top of mind is the key to success.</p>
