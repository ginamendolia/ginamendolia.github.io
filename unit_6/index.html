						<div id="about_main"
							<p><strong><a href="www.openbiome.org">Poop scientist</a> by trade; engineer by design.</strong> I'm driven by unmet public health need, inspired by mindfulness, and attracted to simplicity.</p>
							<p>I tell product stories by researching what people need, brainstorming ideas, prototyping, and iterating based on user feedback. My process is flexible so that my design account for the ecosystem while addressing distinct needs.</p>
							<p>When I am not reimagining systems, you can generally find me doodling, touting the superiority of homemade tomato sauce over Ragu, or somewhere on a mountain--skiing, biking, running, or climbing.</p>
							<p><strong>As a graduate student</strong> at Stanford University, I am interested in how harnessing individual decision making to increase the overall health and sustainability of communities.</p>

					<!-- Design Philosophy Section -->
					<h2>My design philosophy is Nimble Thoughtfulness</h2>
					<h3>always being mindfully observant</h3>
					<p><strong>nimble thoughtfulness</strong> means purposefully thinking about the situations in which people, technology, and business overlap. I look for the places where the design needs to connect to be effective.</p>
					<p>Effective connections are intuitive to the user while empathetic to the rest of the system. </p>
					<p>While making these connections, I belive it’s imperative to keep the operations of technology, the context in people live, and the demand that drives business in mind. </p>

								<p>September 2014 - May 2015</p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Background</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p>One of the most common hospital infections, <span class="sci_words">Clostridium difficile</span>, also known as “C. diff,” inflicts debilitating symptoms, affects over 500,000 Americans each year, and kills almost 30,000 of them.  When antibiotics don’t work, a Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) can be used to send an army of good bacteria into your gut to crowd out the infection. Patients feel better within hours 90 percent of the time! FMT works in just the opposite way antibiotics do. Where antibiotics wipe out infection, FMT overflows the area, leaving the infectious bacteria with nowhere to hide. Until 2015, doctors would administer an FMT via a colonoscopy or endoscopy tube, an invasive but effective medical procedure. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Challenge</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Fecal matter is not the easiest thing to encapsulate. It’s 70 percent water; when you put it into a gelatin capsule, a traditional shell for drugs, the capsule melts from the inside out.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Team</h4>
							</div>
								<div class="content">
								<p>I researched, designed, and executed all experiments. I worked with two microbiology PhDs for scientific support, a physician for clinical oversight, and a manufacturing team to bring the product to life at scale. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Solution</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p>My solution was to create small “fences” around bubbles of poop by mixing a hydrophobic (water-hating) liquid with the hydrophilic (water-loving) active ingredient (the poop).  In real life that means, I created a poop pill: shelf-stable, orally available dosage form of FMT delivered by Microbial Emulsion Matrix Technology (MEM Tech).</p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Impact</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Over 250k pills have been made using my method. To date, the pill I designed has treated over 2,000 patients with C. diff and has been used to study the effects of FMT in 25+ clinical trials including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), immuno-oncology (I/O), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).</p>
							</div>
							<div class="subtitle">
								<h4>Process</h4>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Follow the photos below for descriptions of process, prototypes, and poop geysers. There were a few more ups and downs, many more protoypes, and infinitely more failures not recorded in the following diagrams.</p>

									<h5>First Idea Coating</h5>
									<p>I knew that the water content of poop would melt the capsule from the inside out. So, I considered coating the outside of the capsule to keep the water in.</p>
								</div>
								<div>

									<img src="https://ginamendolia.github.io/unit_6/images/project_poop_pills/hammer_pegboard.JPG" alt="hammer and pegboard" Title="Hammering Out Prototypes">
									<h5>Hammering Out Prototypes</h5>
									<p>While most coating processes are completed at a large scale, I started by making a small peg board to test different coatings.</p>
									<p>Each capsule half rested on top of a nail while I poured the coatings over the top. This seemed promising until these capsules were stuck to the peg board causing the coating to flake off.</p>
								</div>

									<h5>Outsourcing a Better Coat</h5>
									<p>After a few hours, the professionally coated capsules started to pucker leading us to ponder what additional materials I could use to stablize the coating and capsule.</p>

									<h5>Sour Results</h5>
									<p>After a few hours, the professionally coated capsules started to pucker leading us to ponder what additional materials I could use to stablize the coating and capsule.</p>

									<img src="https://ginamendolia.github.io/unit_6/images/project_poop_pills/cracked_capsules.JPG" alt="cracked capsules" Title="Cracked capsules">
									<h5>Adding Strength</h5>
									<p>I experimented with starches to fortify the coating. However, many of the added excipients did not react well to moisture or were too dry and increased flaking and cracking.</p>

									<h5>Mixing up MEM Tech</h5>
									<p>After many more failed prototypes and brainstorming sessions, Microbial Emulsion Matrix Technology was born!</p>
									<p>Emulsions are mixtures of water and oil. I tested oils with varying melting and freezing points to find an oil combination that stayed solid at room temperature to immobilize the water droplets but liquid at body temperature to release the bubbles of microbiota after ingested by the patient.</p>

								<div>
									<img src="https://ginamendolia.github.io/unit_6/images/project_poop_pills/capsule_stability.JPG" alt="capsules on napkin" Title="capsules on napkin">
									<h5>Stability Success</h5>
									<p>After a poop-ton of failures and bad ideas, MEM Tech was a success. It proved to be stable at room temperature as well as resilent in frozen storage. And most importantly, the process seemed to be scalable. Shown is one of the first successful test batches.</p>

									<h5>Scaling Improvements</h5>
									<p>To ensure that the pills could be made at a reasonable scale, I tested the reproducibility of the recipe in larger and larger batches and worked with manufacturing technicians to smooth out handling and operating differences. </p>

								<div>
									<img src="https://ginamendolia.github.io/unit_6/images/project_poop_pills/techs.JPG" alt="Lab technicians in biosafety cabinet" Title="Training the team">
									<h5>Training the Team</h5>
									<p>I wrote standard operating procedures and training work instructions and oversaw one-on-one training of each manufacturing facturing technician. </p>

									<h5>Patenting & Filing a Biologics Master FIle</h5>
									<p>Alongside continuing to optimize the manufacturing process, my boss and I filed a a biologics master file to the FDA and wrote a patent for MEM Tech.</p>

									<h5>Launching Capsule G3</h5>
									<p>Outside of the lab, I sprearheaded the product launch by coordinating the efforts of the external affairs, sales, and manufacturing teams.  I made sure that the sales team was prepared to answer questions from clinicians and that the manufacturing team had enough time and equipment to meet inventory demand. </p>

									<h5>Impacting the Frontier of Microbiome Research</h5>
									<p>After more than 2,000 patients have been treated for C. diff with these poop pills, this product’s impact has reached new patient communities. Each new clinical trial catalyzes microbiome research and deepens our understanding of how bacteria affects our health.</p>

								<p>Be prepared to change your approach for different parts of the process. Development, scaling, and operations rely on different skills. Pausing to acknowledge that you’re shifting your “skill gears” is worth-while. </p>
